# Spicetify-Extensions

A collection of [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) extensions I've written.

## Contents

_This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor is it meant to be. View the individual folders for details._

### Songwhip

An extension to expand the "share" feature by using [Songwhip](https://songwhip.com), a referral site linking to all
found platforms.

## Contributing

If you spot a bug, a typo, or wish to submit your own extension, please view our [contributing
guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

As a general rule of thumb: If your idea implements a new feature, it is best to make it as a stand-alone extension --
That way, the user can decide what to install and use.
